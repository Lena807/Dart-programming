void main() {
  
  List<Student> students=[Student('surya'),
                         Student('keerthi'),
                         Student('rathi'),
                         Student('shiviya')];
  
  print(students);
  
 
  
  
  
} 
  
  class Student{
    final String name;
    
    Student(this.name);
    
    @override
    String toString() => 'Student: $name';
}


output will be,
[Student: surya, Student: keerthi, Student: rathi, Student: shiviya]


// AS soon as we create a class dart automatically create a toString method and we can access it with the @override as mentioned above.
